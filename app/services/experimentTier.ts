/**
 * Experiment participation tiers (issue #21).
 *
 * A second axis, orthogonal to the scientific taxonomy in `experimentClass.ts`.
 * Where the taxonomy answers "is this a real-world projection?", the tiers
 * answer "what role does this experiment play in CMIP7's structure?":
 *
 *  - DECK — the foundational baseline experiments every CMIP7 model runs. The
 *    bedrock that makes models comparable at all.
 *  - AFT (Assessment Fast Track) — a curated, high-priority subset layered on
 *    top of DECK to feed policy assessment sooner.
 *
 * These are stacked, related-but-distinct layers: an experiment can be DECK,
 * AFT, both, or neither. Membership is declared explicitly in
 * `public/experiment-config.json` (`deck`/`aft` booleans) — it is not derivable
 * from the name — and this module holds only the tier *definitions*.
 *
 * REF (Rapid Evaluation Framework) is deliberately NOT a tier here: it is an
 * evaluation-status dimension, not an experiment-membership one, so it lives in
 * its own component (`EvaluationStatus.vue`) rather than as a badge alongside
 * these.
